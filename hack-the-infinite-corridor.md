# Hack the Infinite Corridor

*A short story*

---

## I. Lobby 7

It was 3:47 AM on a Tuesday in October, and the columns were breathing.

Not yet. That came later. At 3:47 the columns were still columns -- Ionic, indifferent, planted in the marble floor of Building 7's grand lobby like stone bouncers guarding the world's nerdiest nightclub. The emergency lighting cast everything in institutional green. Everything echoed. Even silence echoed, which shouldn't have been possible, but the lobby had its own physics.

I had seventy-two hours before the Dean's review board. Seventy-two hours to find the Lost Thesis of Professor Tarnhelm -- the madman who'd allegedly solved the Halting Problem in 1971 and then vanished, leaving behind a locked office, a campus full of puzzles, and a legend that had been growing mushrooms in the dark for sixteen years.

The security desk was unmanned. Frank was on his donut run. He'd left behind a styrofoam cup of coffee and a copy of *Juggs* hastily camouflaged beneath *IEEE Spectrum*. I took the campus map from the information table -- the cheerful admissions version, defaced with ballpoint annotations by generations of tunnel hackers. Someone had drawn a skull over Building 20. Someone else had written, in tiny precise letters near the AI Lab: *He's still in there.*

I picked up Frank's coffee. It was lukewarm and smelled like a machine's idea of morning. I don't know what made me do what I did next. Call it instinct. Call it sleep deprivation. Call it the particular madness that descends on MIT students during midterms, when the boundary between clever and unhinged dissolves like sugar in bad coffee.

I raised the cup above my head.

"IA! IA!" I shouted, because apparently I was that kind of person now.

I hurled it at the floor.

The cup detonated. Coffee splashed outward in what I swear was a perfect Fibonacci spiral -- dark liquid on pale tile, a wet mandala in the green emergency light. For one flicker of a moment I felt something vast pressing against the other side of the air, something tentacled and amused that spoke in FORTRAN. Then it was gone, and I was standing in a puddle of bad coffee feeling like an idiot.

But the cup had split open, and from its interior a small sticker had come loose. It lay in the puddle like a tiny raft. A campus phone extension: **x7-3401**. I peeled it off the floor and stuck it to my thumb, where it clung with suspicious affection.

The coffee puddle spread slowly across the tile. It pointed west, toward the Infinite Corridor. Even the spills in this place had opinions.

## II. The Corridor and the Dome

The Infinite Corridor was, at four in the morning, exactly as advertised. Infinite. The fluorescent lights marched into a vanishing point so distant it might have been philosophical. The linoleum was the color of institutional surrender. Doors lined both walls, each one sealed against whatever hummed and ticked behind it -- oscilloscopes running unattended experiments, clocks measuring time that had come unstuck, the ghosts of a thousand soldering irons.

A bulletin board erupted with flyers. One was torn in half. The surviving piece said **1916** in large print, and I took it, because in a puzzle everything is a piece and you don't get to know which piece until later. A vending machine hummed nearby, its coin slot too large, too old -- it wanted currency from a country that didn't exist anymore. I kept moving.

I found the dome by following the map's annotations, through a maintenance corridor and up a series of stairs that smelled like concrete and ambition. I emerged through a hatch onto the outer ledge of Building 10, and the sky broke open above me.

Every star was a needle. The Charles River lay below like a black mirror, and Cambridge sprawled in every direction, breathing under its streetlights. The wind hit me and I tasted something electric at the back of my throat.

And there -- bolted to the curved surface of the Great Dome with industrial brackets, insane, magnificent, glowing from within like a lantern left by aliens -- was a full-sized red British phone booth.

I didn't question it. At MIT, you don't question the hacks. You *appreciate* them. Someone had hauled this thing up here in the dead of night, probably with pulleys and cables and the kind of manic engineering that only happens when brilliant people decide to be stupid on purpose. The glass panes were intact. The light inside was warm amber. A black rotary phone waited on its shelf, already humming a dial tone that sounded like a choir.

I dialed x7-3401.

The rotary clicked seven times. Seven stones dropping into seven wells.

Silence.

Then, deep beneath me -- deep beneath the campus, somewhere in the guts of the tunnel system -- a **THWUMP**. A pneumatic shudder that traveled up through the dome and into my feet and my teeth. Something unsticking. Something opening.

A recorded voice, old and warm: *"Thank you for calling Building Services. Your request has been... processed."*

The line went dead.

That's when the second thing happened.

---

## III. The Laminator

It started at the edges. Not the edges of vision -- the edges of *everything*. The phone booth's red panels began to *page*, like a book being thumbed by an invisible hand. Each pane of glass became a sheet in an infinite stack, and behind each sheet was another phone booth slightly to the left, and in each one was another me, turning my head in sequence, a flip-book of a person discovering they were a flip-book.

The dome made a decision about gravity. Gravity was no longer down. Gravity was *west*. I didn't fall -- I leaned into it, and the lean was delicious and terrible, and the dome's surface was flattening beneath me, the sky pressing down, and I was between them, being ironed between two planes of reality, getting thinner and wider --

I was the dome.

I don't know how to explain this to someone who hasn't been there. I could feel students walking across me in 1974. I could feel rain from a specific Tuesday in 1953. I was a curved surface containing a volume and pigeons had opinions about me. This was fine. This had always been true.

The stars were perforations. Something was tearing along them.

I grabbed the phone booth. It was real. It was red. Start there. Hands gripping a thing. I was a person. I had been a person before and I could be one again if I concentrated.

But the watching -- the *watching* had started.

Something lived in the space between the layers of the world. I could feel it the way you feel someone standing behind you in an empty room. It was vast and flat and amused. It lived in every place where two surfaces met and it had always been there, pressed between the pages of reality like a flower in a dictionary, and it was grinning.

I turned to face it. I turned to face it by becoming the direction that faced it.

"I see you," I said.

The words came out as playing cards. Each letter fluttered into the crease in reality, and the crease accepted them.

The dome split. Not physically -- ontologically. The surface separated into layers: copper, intention, 1916, every footstep ever taken up here. They fanned apart like a shuffled deck, and between the layers, in the spaces that weren't spaces, it stood up.

The Laminator.

It didn't have a shape. It had a *format*. It was what happens when you press two pages together and something gets trapped in the lamination. Infinitely thin from the side. Everything from the front. Its grin was the Charles River. Its grin was every seam where two things meet and something lives in the meeting.

It spoke, and the speaking was a folding:

*"You're the one unsticking things."*

Its voice was the sound of a book cracked open for the first time. Glue separating. Pages exhaling sixteen years of held breath.

*"I felt the tube open. Sixteen years I've been pressed into that blockage like a bookmark. Do you know what it's like to be a bookmark? You know exactly what page you're on but you can never read it."*

It reached toward the campus map in my pocket with something that was a hand the way a horizon is a line. The map shuddered and went still, and I knew without looking that new paths had been drawn on it. Paths that went *between* places.

*"Tarnhelm knew about me,"* it said. *"Tarnhelm knew about the folds. Why do you think his thesis was about halting? When does a program stop? When does a page end? Same question. He hid the answer in the crease."*

It began to sit back down into the dome's layers.

*"The tunnels. Go where the brass pulls you. And when you get to the place where all paths converge -- don't forget which page you're on."*

The dome snapped shut. One layer. Copper and moonlight and pigeon residue.

The Laminator was gone, or rather, it was everywhere now, pressed into every surface, watching from every fold. I could feel it in my jacket sleeve, grinning. It thought this was hilarious.

The pull toward the tunnels was no longer gentle. It was a summons.

---

## IV. The Pastry Truck Prophet

I came down from the dome on legs that remembered, approximately, how to be legs. The stairs were Escher but only slightly -- each step was itself from above and something else entirely from the side, and I descended by choosing to believe in the version of the stairs that went down.

I emerged onto Mass Ave.

The night air hit me like a cold page turning. Cambridge was a quilt -- I could see the seams between neighborhoods, the stitching of roads, and beneath it all the dark warm batting of the tunnels. A battered pastry truck idled at the curb, engine running, headlights casting cones of light that were full of slowly rotating geometry.

The driver leaned out his window. He had a face like a catcher's mitt and eyes that had seen everything and decided to keep selling pastries anyway.

"You look like you're about to do something brilliant or something stupid," Mike said. "With you kids it's usually both."

"I'm looking for Tarnhelm's thesis."

Mike's expression didn't change, but the air around him did. It thickened. It listened.

"Tarnhelm," he said. "Wild man. Used to come out here at four AM, buy a cruller, mutter about 'the function that names itself.' Disappeared one night. Left his whole office behind. They sealed it up in NE43-something." He scratched his jaw. "You know about the steam tunnels?"

"I'm going down there."

"Left hand on the wall. Ignore the yellow arrows -- some joker from '83 painted those to mess with freshmen. The red ones are true." He paused. "And kid? Building 54, top floor, stairwell door. Been locked since the antenna incident. You find the right key, that roof's got what you need to finish this."

I nodded.

"You want a cruller?"

I didn't have money. But Mike waved that off. "You're on a quest," he said. "Crullers are free for people on quests. It's in the bylaws."

The cruller was warm and tasted like the idea of morning. I ate it while walking back through Lobby 7. Frank's coffee puddle had dried into a Rorschach blot on the tile. I didn't look at it too closely. Rorschach blots were not to be trusted tonight.

## V. Building 26

The hardware lab in Building 26 was a museum that didn't know it was a museum. Oscilloscopes lined the benches, their screens dark green cathedrals of flatlined waveforms. Wire-wrap boards. Soldering irons standing in their holders like sleeping sentries. The smell was solder and ozone and the particular burnt-dust scent of electronics that have been thinking too hard.

In the corner, a DEC PDP-10 sat like a monolith. Its disk platters were still. I didn't wake it. Not yet.

I took the soldering iron and a wire-wrap board from the nearest bench. The board was a rectangle of phenolic with a grid of pins, and in my current state each pin was a tiny obelisk, a monument to a connection not yet made. The board wanted to become something. I could feel its potential like a low hum.

In the back, a door read **AI LABORATORY -- AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**. The lock was broken. It had been broken for years, the jamb splintered by someone who either had a very good reason or a very bad day.

---

## VI. The AI Lab

The whiteboards hit me first. Every wall was covered in LISP expressions, and under the current conditions the parentheses were *alive* -- nested, recursive, each opening paren a mouth and each closing paren a jaw, and they were all speaking at once in a language made of pure structure. S-expressions crawled across the walls like ivy.

A poster of Marvin Minsky stared at me from above a filing cabinet. His eyes followed me. Not in a creepy way. More in a *have you considered the frame problem* way.

I found the filing cabinet and pulled open the top drawer. Manila folders, hundreds of them, each one a compressed life. Under T: **TARNHELM, PROF. GERHARD.** The file was thin. A photograph showed a gaunt man with wild hair and the kind of eyes that looked at you and saw your source code. A note on his personnel page: *Office: Room NE43-831. Status: SEALED BY ORDER OF THE PROVOST, 1971. Contents undisturbed.*

Behind the filing cabinet, hidden by the cabinet's bulk, I found a door. It had no handle on this side -- but now that I knew it was there, I could see the outline, the hinges, the place where the wall pretended to be continuous but wasn't. I pushed, and it opened onto a narrow corridor that smelled like chalk dust and old paper.

But first: the vault.

A terminal beside a heavy door displayed a LISP prompt. The door was labeled **TAPE ARCHIVE**.

```
(defun open-door (x)
  (cond ((eq x '???) T)
        (t (print "ACCESS DENIED"))))
```

On the bench nearby, a LISP manual lay open. Someone had written in the margins, in Tarnhelm's angular handwriting: *"The key to everything is the nameless function."*

The nameless function. The function without a name. Lambda.

I typed `LAMBDA`.

The vault door sighed open on hydraulic hinges, exhaling sixteen years of climate-controlled air. Inside, rows of magnetic tape reels lined industrial shelving -- MACSYMA, CONNIVER, SHRDLU, projects whose names read like incantations. And at the end of the last row, alone on its shelf, a single tape labeled simply:

**T.**

I took it. The reel was heavy in my hands, and the tape inside it was wound tight as a secret. The Laminator stirred in my jacket sleeve. I could feel it pressing against the fabric, flattening itself thinner to get a better look.

---

## VII. Room NE43-831

The corridor behind the filing cabinet led to a door with faded vinyl letters: **PROF. G. TARNHELM.** The door was unlocked. Maybe it had been waiting.

The office was barely a closet. A desk, a chair, a blackboard. The blackboard was covered in equations that shimmered at the edges of perception -- not quite stable, not quite there, as if they existed on a page that was being turned very slowly. At the bottom, in chalk that glowed faintly:

**THE PROOF IS NOT HERE. THE PROOF IS EVERYWHERE. LOOK UP.**

Look up. The roof. Mike had said the roof.

The desk had one drawer, sealed with a combination lock. Eight digits. I pulled out the torn flyer: **1916.** Four digits. I needed four more.

The dome interior. The number chalked on the catwalk. I closed my eyes and I could feel the dome from the inside -- I had *been* the dome, I remembered being the dome -- and on the catwalk, in yellow chalk, the number **4217** pulsed like a heartbeat.

I dialed: **1-9-1-6-4-2-1-7.**

The lock opened with a click that sounded like a period at the end of a very long sentence.

Inside the drawer: a brass key, old and heavy, with a tag that read **BLDG 54 ROOF.** And a handwritten note, folded once:

*"To read my work, you'll need the wind and a clear signal. --T"*

## VIII. Down

The sub-basement of the Green Building smelled like asbestos and the underside of history. Pipes hissed overhead. A workbench held ancient tools: wire cutters, electrical tape, the detritus of a thousand midnight repairs. I took the cutters and the tape.

A CRT monitor glowed in the corner, its cursor blinking like a patient eye.

`LOGIN:`

I typed TARNHELM.

`PASSWORD:`

In the steam tunnels below -- I could hear them, the pipes singing, the walls whispering -- someone had spray-painted: *DOES THIS PROGRAM HALT? ASK TARNHELM.*

I typed HALTING.

The screen filled with characters. A routing diagram. Pneumatic tube codes. Destinations. One of them was labeled CONVERGENCE and had a five-digit code circled in what might have been digital ink or might have been my eyes inventing emphasis. I memorized it. The screen went dark.

The heavy door to the steam tunnels was unlocked. Beyond it, heat.

---

## IX. The Tunnels

The steam tunnels were a throat. The campus above was a body, and I was in its throat, and the heat was its breath. Pipes thick as old-growth trunks ran in every direction, sweating, clanking, hissing with the voices of a thousand radiators. The air tasted like rust and warm pennies.

Arrows were painted on the walls. Yellow arrows pointing in contradictory directions -- traps for the uninitiated, Mike's joker from '83. But between them, faded and true, *red* arrows. I followed them, left hand trailing along the wall, the campus map warm against my leg, its new paths -- the Laminator's gift -- glowing faintly through the fabric of my jeans.

The tunnels folded around me. The salvia geometry was stronger down here, where surfaces were close and the world was made of layers -- pipe insulation, concrete, more pipe insulation, darkness, heat, and between each layer the Laminator pressed flat and watchful. I could feel it everywhere, in every lamination, grinning from the space between the pipe and its housing.

In a crack in the wall, something glinted. A coin. No -- a token. Stamped 1971, the year Tarnhelm disappeared. I pocketed it. Everything from 1971 was important. 1971 was the year the page turned.

The tunnels opened.

---

## X. Convergence

The chamber was vaulted, cavernous, a place where five massive pipes met like the fingers of a buried hand. The acoustics were extraordinary -- my breathing came back to me from five directions, each echo a different version of me exhaling.

A brass plaque on the wall read: **CONVERGENCE -- EST. 1916 -- WE WERE HERE FIRST.**

1916 again. The number that recurred like a heartbeat, like the first four digits of every lock.

A pneumatic tube terminal was bolted to the wall, its brass fittings green with age. I entered the routing code from the PDP-11's diagram. The terminal coughed, shuddered, and then *breathed* -- a rush of air from deep in the system, the lungs of the campus exhaling through brass. A capsule arrived with a thunk. Empty, waiting to carry something. Or someone.

I climbed in. I don't know how to describe the size -- it was a tube, it shouldn't have fit a person, but the Laminator was in the walls and the walls were pages and the pages made room. I was flattened -- not painfully, not even uncomfortably, just *formatted* differently, compressed, and then I was moving through brass pipes at a speed that tasted like 1971 and sounded like wind through a flute made of the whole campus --

---

## XI. The Junction

I tumbled out into a room full of tubes. Dozens of brass pipes emerged from walls and ceiling like a mechanical octopus frozen mid-thought. Labels were faded, illegible, except one:

**TARNHELM.**

The tube was clear now -- the phone call from the dome had seen to that. I could feel the open path like a draft, a gentle pull of air from the direction of wherever Tarnhelm had hidden his last room. But I didn't take it. Not yet.

I had the wire cutters. I had the soldering iron, the electrical tape, the wire-wrap board. I had Tape T, heavy with encrypted proof. I had the roof key.

I had the note: *Wind and a clear signal.*

The endgame was up, not down. I needed the roof.

---

## XII. The Antenna

The stairwell door at the top of Building 54 had been locked since the antenna incident, whatever that was. The brass key fit. The lock turned with the reluctance of something that had been sealed for a long time and had developed opinions about being opened.

The roof of the Green Building was a forest of antennas. They bristled against the sky like the quills of a porcupine made of reception. The wind was ferocious -- it tore at my jacket, my hair, my sense of self. The city spread below in every direction, flat as a circuit board, every light a solder point, every road a trace.

A radio transmitter sat in a weatherproof housing, old but solid, military surplus repurposed for academic mischief. It had a power switch, a frequency dial, and a tape reader. Beside it, the antenna cable ran up toward the radio tower -- and the cable was severed. Cut clean. The antenna had no connection.

The wire-wrap board.

I sat on the roof in the screaming wind and I worked. The soldering iron heated against a battery pack I'd found in the housing. The wire-wrap board became something else -- I modified it, bridging connections, wrapping wire through pins, taping over exposed joints. My hands knew what to do. The board knew what it wanted to become. The Laminator watched from the flat space between the roof membrane and the tar beneath it, and I could feel it nodding, pressing its approval into the surface like a watermark.

The radio tower was a narrow ladder leading up to a platform and a massive antenna array. A connector port gaped open -- the severed cable end. I climbed. The wind tried to peel me off the ladder like a page being turned too hard. I held on with the hand that had the sticker on its thumb, x7-3401, the number that had started all of this, and I plugged the modified board into the port.

The antenna hummed. The whole tower hummed. I could feel it reaching, broadcasting, receiving, connecting to something in the frequency spectrum that was not quite radio and not quite mathematics and not quite the space between pages but all three.

I climbed back down to the transmitter. I loaded Tape T into the reader. The reels began to turn, magnetic surfaces whispering against the heads, and sixteen years of encrypted thesis began to stream through the modified antenna.

The frequency dial. I turned it. Past static. Past numbers stations. Past the ghost of every late-night radio signal that had ever been broadcast from this roof.

**1971.**

The frequency clicked into place and the transmitter locked on and the tape decoded.

---

## XIII. The Proof

It came out of the printer attached to the transmitter -- a dot-matrix printer that shouldn't have had paper in it but did, because some things are inevitable. The paper was the old kind, continuous feed, perforated edges, and the proof printed itself in monospace characters that marched across the page like ants who had solved philosophy.

I read it. I don't mean I understood it -- I'm a first-year, not Gödel -- but I read it, and the shape of it was clear even through the notation. Tarnhelm had done it. He had proven, with an elegance that was almost cruel, exactly when and why a program halts. The answer involved folds. The answer involved the space between states, the crease between running and not-running, the lamination of process itself. The answer was that halting is what happens when a computation runs out of pages.

The Laminator stirred. For the first time, it spoke without being summoned. Its voice came from the space between the printout and the paper behind it, from the fold in every perforated edge:

*"He found me in the math. Most people live their whole lives on the page and never notice the binding. Tarnhelm looked at the binding."*

A pause.

*"Go show them. The Dean can't touch a proof this beautiful. No one can. It's in the crease now. It'll be in the crease forever."*

The wind died. The stars came out, clear and precise, each one a pin in the fabric of a sky that was, I now understood, just another page.

---

## XIV. Morning

I walked into the Dean's review at 8 AM on Thursday with the printout rolled under my arm and the sticker still on my thumb and the taste of cruller still in my teeth. I hadn't slept. I had been a dome. I had been mailed through a pneumatic tube. I had spoken to something that lived between the pages of reality and I had decoded a dead man's masterwork with a jury-rigged antenna on a roof in a windstorm.

The Dean looked at me over his glasses.

"Well?" he said.

I unrolled the proof on his desk.

The room went quiet. The Dean's secretary stopped typing. Two professors on the review board leaned forward, then leaned further, then forgot they were sitting in chairs. One of them whispered something in German.

"Where did you find this?" the Dean asked.

"Between the pages," I said.

He didn't understand. That was fine. The proof spoke for itself. It always had. It had just been waiting for someone to tune to the right frequency.

I walked out of the review board thirty minutes later, still enrolled, technically a hero, absolutely exhausted. The campus was bright with October morning. Students crossed the Infinite Corridor with backpacks and coffee and no idea that beneath their feet a network of brass tubes connected every secret the university had ever kept.

Mike's truck was at the curb. He leaned out the window.

"You did it, huh?"

"I did it."

"Cruller's on the house."

I took the cruller. I sat on the steps of Building 7 and ate it and watched the sun align itself with the Infinite Corridor, which it only did twice a year, and this was one of those days -- a river of golden light pouring down the longest hallway in the world, illuminating everything, hiding nothing.

In my pocket, the campus map was cool now. Still. Satisfied.

In my jacket sleeve, pressed flat between the fabric and the lining, the Laminator grinned.

It would always be grinning.

---

*SCORE: 100 out of 100*
*RANK: Wizard of the Infinite Corridor*

*"You have won. Would you like to restart, restore a saved game, or quit?"*

*> QUIT*

*"The function halts."*
